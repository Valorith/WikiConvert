== Checklist ==

The Druid epic quest is very similar to live with a few key exceptions.  One is that the dialog has been changed slightly, so be sure to pay attention when working through the quest.  Second - and probably most important - is that handing the [[Froglok Essence]] to [[Dolgin Codslayer]] will not spawn [[Faydedar]] - instead Dolgin will eat the Essence.  You instead will have to kill the open world or instance version of Faydedar to loot the [[Pod of Seawater]].   <br>
